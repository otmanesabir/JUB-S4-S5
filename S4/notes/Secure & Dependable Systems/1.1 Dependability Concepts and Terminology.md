<h2 style="color:#BB86FC">System and Environment and System Boundary</h2>

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition</h3>

A _system_ is an entity that interacts with other entities, i.e., other systems, including hardware, software, humans and the physical world with its natural phenomena. The other systems are the _environment_ of the given system. The _system boundary_ is the common frontier between the system and its environment.


<h2 style="color:#BB86FC">Componenets & States</h2>

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Componenents</h3>

The structure of a system is composed out of a set of componenets, where each component is another system. The recursion stops when a component is considered atomic.

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Total State</h3>

The _total state_ of a given system is the set of the following states: computation, communication, stored information, interconnection, and physical condition.

<h2 style="color:#BB86FC">Function and Behaviour</h2>
<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition  - Functional</h3>

The _function_ of a system is what the system is intended to do and is described by the functional specification.

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition  - Behavior</h3>

The _behavior_ of a system is what the system does to implement its function and is described by a sequence of states.

<h2 style="color:#BB86FC">Service and Correct Service</h2>

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition  - Service</h3>

The _service_ delivered by a system is its behaviour as it is perceived by a its user(s); a user is another system that receives service from the service provider.

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition  - Correct Service</h3>

_Correct service_ is delivered when the service implement the system function.

Recall that the system function is defined in the functional specification. If the functional specification is incomplete, then the service provided can be undefined in certain situtations, i.e., it is neither correct nor incorrect.

<h2 style="color:#BB86FC">Failure versus Error versus Fault</h2>

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition  - Failure</h3>

A _service failure_, often abbreaviated as _failure_, is an event that occurs when the delivered service deviates from correct service.


<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition  - Error</h3>

An _error_ is the part of the total state of the system that may lead to its subsequent service failure.

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition  - Fault</h3>

A _fault_ is the adjudged or hypothesized cause of an error. A fault is active when it produces an error, otherwise it is dormant.


It follows that it is desirable:
  * to avoid faults and to reduce faults, and
  * to prevent dormant faults from getting activated, and
  * to detect and handle errors so that they do not propagate, and
  * to detect and handle failures of other components or systems, and
  * to reduce the number of ways external phenoma can inject faults.

<h2 style="color:#BB86FC">Dependability</h2>

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition  - Dependability Original</h3>

_Dependability_ is the ability of a system to deliver service that can justifiably be trusted.

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition  - Dependability Revised</h3>

_Dependability_ of a system is the ability to avoid service failures that are more frequent and more sever than is acceptable.


* The revised definition provides a criterion for deciding if a system is dependable.


<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Dependability Attributes</h3>

Dependability has the following attributes:
  * _Availability_: readiness to deliver correct service
  * _Reliability_: continuity of correct service
  * _Safety_: absense of catastrophoc consequences on the user(s) and the environment
  * _Integrity_: absense of improper system alterations
  * _Maintainability_: ability to undergo modifications and repairs
  * _Confidentiality_: absence of unauthorized disclosure of information.

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Dependability and Security</h3>

_Security_ is a composite of the attributes of confidentiality, integrity and availability.

* The definition of dependability considers security as a subfield of dependability. This does, however, not reflect how research communities have organized themselves.


<h2 style="color:#BB86FC">Fault Prevention</h2>

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition (fault prevention)</h3>

_Fault prevention_ aims at preventing the occurance or introduction of faults.

* Application of good software engineering techniques and quality management techniques during the entire development process.
* Hardening, shielding, etc. of physical systems to prevent physical faults.
* Maintenance and deployment procedures (e.g., firewalls; installation in access controlled rooms, backup procedures) to prevent malicious faults.

<h2 style="color:#BB86FC">Fault Tolerance</h2>

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition (fault tolerance)</h3>

_Fault tolerance_ aims at avoiding service failures in the presence of faults.

* Error detection aims at detecting errors that are present in the system so that recovery actions can be taken.
* Recovery handling eliminates errors from the system by rollback to an error-free state or by error compensation (exploiting redundancy) or by rolldorward to an error-free state.
* Fault handling prevents located faults from being activated again.

<h2 style="color:#BB86FC">Fault Removal</h2>

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition (fault removal)</h3>

_Fault removal_ aims at reducing the number of severity faults.

* Fault removal during the development phase usually involves verification checks whether the system satisfies required properties.

* Fault removal during the operational phase is often driven by errors that have been detected and reported (corrective maintenance) or by faults that have been observed in similar systems or that were found in the specification but which have not led to errors yet.

* Sometimes it is impossible or too costly to remove a fault but it is possible to prevent the activation of the fault or to limit the possible impact of the fault, i.e, its severity.

<h2 style="color:#BB86FC">Fault Forecasting</h2>

<h3 style="color:#03DAC5">Definition (fault forecasting)</h3>

_Fault forecasting_ aims at estimating the present number, the future incidences, and the likely consequences of faults.

* Qualitative evaluation identifies, classifies, and ranks the failure modes, or the event combinations that would lead to failures.

* Quantitative evaluation determines the probabilities to which some of the dependability attributes satisfied.
