# Semester 4 Notes

Some notes from my 4th semester that might be helpful if you're taking CS at JUB.
They're all written in Markdown but also embed some latex and mermaid stuff so you might not get the ideal preview experience from Github - they look much prettier on 
good MD preview programs. <br>
The one I use is [Notable](https://notable.app/) which I think is only available on macOS, so if you don't use that then, oh well, sucks to be you :)

Hope this helps :heart:
