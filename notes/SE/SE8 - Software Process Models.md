# SE8 - Software Process Models

## Software Process Models

<h3><font color="#BB86FC">Waterfall Model</font></h3>

```mermaid
graph LR
  id1[requirements definition] --> id2[system and software design]
  id2 --> id3[implementation and software design]
  id3 --> id4[integration and system testing]
  id4 --> id5[operation and maintenance]
  id5 --> id4
  id5 --> id3
  id5 --> id2
  id5 --> id1
```

* Partitioning into distinct stages
  * Difficult to accommodate change after process is underway
  * Inflexible

* Few business systems have stable requirements
  * Changing customer requirements
  * Increasing domain understanding
  * Unforeseen technical difficulties

* Only appropriate when requirements well-understood and fairly stable. 
* Mostly used for large systems engineering projects where system is developed at several sites.


<h3><font color="#BB86FC">The incremental model</font></h3>

`Increment 1`

```mermaid
graph TD
communication --> reqs
reqs --> design
design --> impl
impl --> integration
integration --> operation
```

We then deliver `increment 1` and proceed to start with the next one, in such a way that each process begins the next iteration as soon as its done with the previous and does not wait on the linear sequence to finish.

<h4><font color="#CF6679">Incremental Delivery</font></h4>

* Development & delivery broken down into increments
  * each increment delivering part of the required functionality
* User requirements are prioritised
  * highest priority requirements included in early increments
* Once development of increment is started, requirements are frozen
  * requirements for later increments can continue to evolve.

<h4><font color="#CF6679">Incremental Dev. Appraisal</font></h4>

* Customer value delivered with each increment
  * system functionality is available earlier
* Early increments act as a prototype
  * help elicit requiremenets for later increments
* Lower risk of overall project failure
* Highest priority system services tend to receive most testing

<h4><font color="#CF6679">Extreme Programming</font></h4>

* An 'extreme' variation of iterative developemeent based on very small increments :
  * New versions may be built several times per day;
  * Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks or so;
  * All tests must be run for every build; build only accepted if all tests run successfully.
* Relies on
  * Constant code improvement
  * User involvement in the development team
  * Pairwise programming
* Perhaps best-known & most widely used agile method


<h4><font color="#CF6679">Pair Programming</font></h4>

* Programmers work in pairs, sitting together to develop code 
  * helps develop common ownership of code
  * spreads knowledge across the team
  * cross checking of all code
* Informal review process 
  * Each line of code looked at by more than 1 person
* Encourages refactoring
  * Whole team can benefit
* Measurements suggest that development productivity is similar to independent work.


<h4><font color="#CF6679">XP and Change</font></h4>

* Conventional widsom: design for change
  * worth spending time & effort anticipating changes
  * reduces costs later in the life cycle
* XP, however, maintains that this is not worthwhile
  * cannot be reliably anticipated
* Rather, it proposes constant code improvement
  * make changes easier when they have to be implemented

<h4><font color="#CF6679">The XP Release Cycle</font></h4>

```mermaid
graph TD
id1[select user stories for this release] --> id2[breakdown: stories -> tasks]
id2 --> id3[plan release]
id3 --> id4[developÂ / integrate / test]
id4 --> id5[release]
id5 --> id6[evaluate]
id6 --> id1
```

<h4><font color="#CF6679">Consequences of Extreme Programming</font></h4>

* Incremental Planning
  * Stories determined by time available + relative priority
* Small releases
  * Minimal useful set of functionality that provides business value is developed first
* Collective ownership
  * Pairs of developers work on <b>all</b> areas of system.
  * no islands of expertise, all developers own all code.
  * <b><font color="red">Anyone can change anything</font></b>
* Simple design
  * Enough design to meet current requirements and no more
* Simple code : Refactoring
* Sustainable pace
  * No large amounts of over-time which often reduced code quality and medium term productivity.
* On-site Customer
  * End-user representative <b><font color="red"> available full time </font></b>
  * <b><font color="red"> Customer member </font></b> of development team and is reponsible for bringing system requirements to the team.

<h4><font color="#CF6679">Agile Methods : Appraisal</font></h4>

* Team members may be unsuited to the <b><font color="red">intense involvement</font></b> of agile methods. 
* Developers need to be experienced, not too different in expertise.
* Can be difficult to keep intreset of customers involved in process.
* <b><font color="red"> Maintaining simplicity</b></font> requires extra work.
* Contracts may be a problem as prioritising changes can be difficult when there are multiple stakeholders as with other approaches to iterative development.
* Agile methods probably best suited to small/medium-sized business systems. <b><font color="red">short-term, highly flexible projects</font></b>

<h3><font color="#BB86FC">Scrum</font></h3>

```mermaid

id1[Product Backlog] --> id2[Sprint Backlog]
id2 --> id3[Sprint]
idx[Daily Scrum Meetings] --> id3
id3 --> id4[Potentially Deliv. Prod. Inc.]
id3 --> id2
```


<h4><font color="#CF6679">Scrum Componenets</font></h4>

* Scrum Roles :
  * Product Owner
    * Knows what needs to be built & in what sequence this should be done.
  * Scrum Master
    * Represents management to the project. Responsible for enacting scrum values and practices with a main goal to remove obstructions.
  * Scrum Team
    * Typically 5-6 full-time self-organizing cross-functional people (QA, Programmers, UI Designers, etc.).
    * Membership can only change between sprints.
* Scrum Process
  * Spring Planning Meeting
  * Kickoff Meeting
  * Sprint (~Iteration in a Unified Process)
  * Daily Scrum Meeting
  * Sprint Review Meeting
* Scrum Artifacts
  * Product Backlog
    * A list of requirements (features, bug fixes, non-funct. requirements) prioritized by the product owner to focus on customer value such that the feature sequence is the same as the delivery sequence.
    * Product backlog & business value items is a responsibility of Product Owner; however, the item size (estimated complexity/effort) determined by development team.
  * Spring Backlog
    * Items development team must deliver during next sprint.
  * Burndown Charts
    * Public displayed chart showing remaining work in sprint backlog.
