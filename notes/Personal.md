The reason why you don't want to do stuff is because you're afraid of failure because you think everyone will find out about what/who you truly are. That's fine. It's still under control and you can actually do it.

The minute you have hope you strive to do more. You can do it, if you really want to. It's possible still, just be smart and play your cards right.
